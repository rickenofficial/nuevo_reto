In the following challenge, I added a modal to incorporate the datepicker using jQuery UI, allowing users to select dates. Additionally, I implemented functions in our script to create IDs and render elements. I also included a function to enable dragging and dropping of the task cards, along with a delete button for removing them.

Here's how our modal with the functioning datepicker looks like.

And this is how our task card looks like once we've added it, depending on the deadline, the color changes.
